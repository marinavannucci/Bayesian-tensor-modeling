# Bayesian-tensor-modeling

Functions to implement Bayesian tensor modeling under SVM loss (BT-SVM) and logistic loss (BT-LR).

Bayesian_tensor_svm: Bayesian tensor modeling under SVM loss (BT-SVM)

Bayesian_tensor_logistic: Bayesian tensor modeling under a logistic type loss (BT-LR)

Each R file contains a sample code at the end. All required R packages are included in the file. Use any R version that supports all required packages.
